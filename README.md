# MedStudyHub Landing Page

This project contains a simple landing page for medical students with resources, flashcards, and premium content.

## Development

Run a local server using Node's built-in HTTP module:

```bash
npm start
```

The page will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Testing

A basic test mode starts the server in test mode without binding to a port:

```bash
npm test
```
